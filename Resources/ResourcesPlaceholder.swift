// This is a placeholder file for the Resources directory.
// Assets like custom fonts, images, etc., should be added here.
// For example, you might add a custom font file like 'MyCustomFont.ttf'
// or an image asset catalog like 'Assets.xcassets'.

// Note: For Xcode projects, resources are typically managed directly
// through the project navigator and target settings, not necessarily
// via Swift files like this, unless it's for programmatic access
// to resource names or similar.
